# hello-world
This is my first repository

I'm making this because I want to host two of my sites here. One is already up on HostGator, but it's just HTML so there's no need for all the fanciness that Wordpress provides. The other exists as a text file.

One is called DontDumbBeSmart. It's a site where I try to encourage people to improve their lives by observing the world and using the learnings to your advantage.

The other is LivingWithotStuff, which is more of a personal journal. I made it my goal for this year to simplify my life as much as possible, and this is sort of a result of that. I realize that simplification is an ongoing project, so I won't have simplified as much as possible in all time, because there is always another way to simplify further. I forsee this site becoming a way for me to share my story of continuous simplification.

If you're reading this, and only if you're reading this, I hope you enjoy my work.
